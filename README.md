# Hyprkube
## Introduction
Managing large fleets of Kubernetes clusters can be challenging and repetitive. Hyprkube aims to
make a cluster administrator's life easier by rethinking how we interact with resources in Kubernetes.

Please note that this project is still far away from an MVP-status and is not suitable for production use.

## Highlights
- **Customizable resource views** allow you to customize the columns you want to see. 
- **Pinned Kinds** allow you to focus on the resources you care about - no more scrolling through
an endless list of CRDs
